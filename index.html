          <p>Created in 1996 by Doepfer Musikelektronik, the eurorack has now grown to
            become the dominant hardware in modular synthesis. A DIY industry that has spawned over 
            300 different manufacturers within this open source community. Eurorack has become an ever 
            growing music instrument that can be used in so many different creative and expressive outputs. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            Many different types of musicians, producers and artists have embraced this instrument.
            Creating communities of afficiando's throughout the world. Because if its compact size, the eurorack 
            makes it easier to play live and takes up less space in a studio setting than its predecessors.
            The eurorack is used with 3.5 mono jack patch cables which also helps with affordability.
            Dieter Döpfer is credited for inventing the modern eurorack format. Because the technology was never patented, other 
            manufacturers adopted the format bringing in many different ideas and approaches to creating modules. Companies 
            like Make Noise, Noise Engineering, 4MS, Qu-Bit electronix, intellijel, TipTop Audio, Malekko, instruo, buck modular,
            mutable instruments, mystic circuits, and many more are large contributors to the progress of this cottage industry.  Even legacy synth companies like moog have created eurorack
            compatible semi-modular units like the Mother 32, DFAM, and most recently the subharmonicon.

            The really cool thing about the eurorack format is that it gives the music maker the ability to combine 
            and frankenstein a custom system using modules by any manufacterer 
            within the same custumizable case. Making modular synthesis much more accessible to new and curious creative music makers.
            Small groups of like minded musicians have created communities throughout the world.  Modular On The Spot created by Bana Hafar
            and Eric[rodent]Cheslak is a monthly modular concert picnic that takes place outdoors and is always free.  Starting in Los Angeles and spreading 
            to other communities, there are now several groups of individuals from different states and countries doing their version of Modular On The Spot. 
            There are also quite a few online resources, specialty shops, and forums to help with advice, education, and support for those interested and 
            curious about modular synthesis. Online resources such as ModularGrid and Muff Wiggler are really good for online community support and advice
            when it comes to building a system or just sharing information and education.  Specialty stores like 
            Anologue Haven, Perfect Circuit, and Noisebug are a good starting place to find the components needed to buil a system.
